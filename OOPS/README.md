OOPS
----

- Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance.
<br/>

- Java OOPs concept refers to programming languages that use objects in programming
- They use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code.
- Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks you assign.
<br/>

- Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming.
- _The main aim of OOPs is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function_
<br/>

- Procedural programming (Classic) is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
<br/>

Apart from regular OOPS concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:

- Coupling
- Cohesion
- Association
- Aggregation
- Composition
