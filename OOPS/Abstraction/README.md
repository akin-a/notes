## Abstraction

- Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world.
- Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms.
- It’s used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.

- Abstraction in Java is the process in which we only show essential details/functionality to the user. The non-essential implementation details are not displayed to the user.

- **Abstraction in Real life**
    - Your car is a great example of abstraction. You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button. You don’t need to know how the engine is getting 
      started, what all components your car has. The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user.
    - We can heat our food in Microwave. We press some buttons to set the timer and type of food. Finally, we get a hot and delicious meal. The microwave internal details are 
      hidden from us. We have been given access to the functionality in a very simple manner.
