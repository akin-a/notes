## Inheritence

- Mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class
- The idea behind inheritance in Java is that we can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
- When we inherit methods from an existing class, we can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. However, we can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
- We are achieving inheritance by using **extends** keyword.
- Inheritance is also known as “**is-a**” relationship.
- _Superclass_ : The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass (also known as base or parent class).
- _Subclass_: The class that inherits the other class is known as subclass (also known as derived or extended or child class).
- _Reusability_: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class

- A class can inherit/extend only one class.
- Then how come the multiple inheritence is achieved?
- Interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
