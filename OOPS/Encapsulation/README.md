## Encapsulation

- Mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates.
- A protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
- Technically, in encapsulation, the variables or the data in a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of the class in which they are declared.
- Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in a class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of the variables.
- In encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, which is similar to what data-hiding does. So, the terms “encapsulation” and “data-hiding” are used interchangeably.
- Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, known as a class. It helps protect an object’s internal state by restricting direct access to its attributes and providing controlled access through public methods.
