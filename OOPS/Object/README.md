## CLASS AND OBJECT

- Object is an **entity** that has a state and a behavior.
- An Object can be defined as an instance of a class.
- It contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
- Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code.

- Class is a collection of Objects. It is a logical entitiy.
- A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
- Class does not consume any space.

- A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
- When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
