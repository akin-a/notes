## Coupling

- Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class.
- It arises when classes are aware of each other.
- If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling and vice versa.
- Two types, **Tight** coupling and **Loose** coupling.

### Tight coupling

In the below example, change in one class will cause the change in another class as well. This is tight coupling.

### Loose coupling

Interface is one way to acheieve loose coupling (in below example, the 2 classes are completely independent), there are other ways too like Dependency injection etc
