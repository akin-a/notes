## Cohesion

- Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task
- A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method
- The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts.
- Practical examples:
   - The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface.
   - However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.
